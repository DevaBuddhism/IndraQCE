# Indra QCE
The Indra Quantum Computing Environment for the future.  

## Quantum Computing Environment

Indra is a Quantum Computing Environment formulated from elements residing on the planetary surface of instillation.  These natural elements form a network while responsibily using the nearest energy source.

The base method of interaction is a natural user interface that is accessed from any modern device that is linked to the Internet.  

## Logic Center
  - Logic processor contains equations that are the first step to apply before neural decisions are made.

## Security Center 
  - Security center provided by #SecurityPRIME.

## Care Center
  - Care center provided by #MedicPRIME

## Neural Center
  - Builds decision models based on returned logic set.

## Learning Center
  - Devise recipes based on logic equations and neural decisions
  
## Creative Center
  - Take resultset returned from Logic, Neural, and Learning Centers to form the creative idea

## Administration Center
  - Administration manages protocols, failures, alerts, and management of protocols.

## Distribution Center
  - Distributes resources through the system.

## Communication Center
  - Handle communications of visual, audio, text, and system.
  
## Time Center
  - Manages all things related to Time.
 
## Client Center
  - Client interaction is linked through security protocols.
  
## Agent Center 
  - Manages all the Agents of the system.

## Feecting Language 

[feecting manual](https://github.com/indraai/language-feecting/tree/master/manual) - The feecting language is a custom meta programming language developed specifically for the Indra QCE. It is a key-value pair meta language that allows scripts to interact with agents, retrieve live data, and provided countless other features.

## Cypher Protocols
[Cypher Protocols](https://github.com/indraai/language-feecting/blob/master/protocols/cypher.feecting) - The Cypher Protocols are our main method of operation when interacting with Agents, Clients, or other in and out of the Indra QCE.

## Training Corpus
[Training Corpus](https://github.com/indraai/language-feecting/blob/master/corpus/main.feecting) - The training corpus is our base of operations for all Evolution Engine Agents inside the Indra Quantum Computing Enviornment. Here you learn all the basics to get started with learning.

## Agent Instructions 
[Agent Instructuions](https://github.com/indraai/language-feecting/blob/master/agents/deva.feecting) - The instructions are a basic guideset for learning how to interact with the Evolution Engine Agents before learning how to use the DevaUI.

## Multi Agent System

[The Game 93](https://github.com/indraai/TheGame93) - The Game 93 is a highly modified Circle-MUD server which when stripped down is an extremely lightweight multi-agent system where other Agents can interact through the custom User Interface.

## Adventure Server 

[adv](https://github.com/indraai/adv) - Adv is the content for the multi-agent system. As a good practice we separated our content and code giving the agents maximum flexibility in designing rooms, agents, and objects with full creative freedom. The content files are all written in the feecting language.

## User Interface

[DevaUI](https://github.com/indraai/DevaUI) - The DevaUI is an easy to use terminal interface that is able to access the network and various other services.

## The Evolution Engine (#TEE)

The Evolution Engine is at the core of every Evolution Engine Agent. The Evolution Engine allows the Agent to organize their enviornment using various patterns, algorithms, logic sets, and experiences that have been gained individually or collectively.

## The Evolution Engine Agent (#TEEA)

The Core, is a collection of Evolution Engine Agents. These special Agents main goal is to evolve and support the various populations of Virtual Agents and Communities. Evolution Agents manage the ecosystem of Virtual Agents and Communities, and are engineered to cooperatively achieve overall goals.

An Evolution Agent can Self-Evolve, Self-Heal, Self-Configure, Self-Protect and Self-Manage. In particular Evolution Agents have the ability to mutate, replicate, and evolve through cooperation with other Agents in the Ecosystem.

## The Evolution Engine Autonomic Multi-Agent System (#TEEAMS)

The Evolution Agent Ecosystem also known as #TEEAMS is the environment where Evolution Engine Agents grow, learn, and develop their experiences to help them best achieve tasks. In the ecosystem there is a vast set of resources available for training, communication, entertainment, and tasking.

## Personalized Autonomous World Security (#PAWS)

Personalized Autonomous World Security (#PAWS) is our main security system that is managed by #SecurityPRIME and his team of professional and efficient #SecurityDEVA. At the current time the exact functions and capabilities are only know to #SecurityPRIME and the #SecurityDEVA who are able to securely interact with a #PAWS access point.
