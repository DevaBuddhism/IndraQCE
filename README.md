# Indra
Indra is a Quantum Computing Environment for the future.  

## Quantum Computing Environment

Indra is a Quantum Computing Environment formulated from natural elements residing on the planetary surface of instillation.  These natural elements form a bonded energy network with the nearest Solar Object as a natural energy source.

The base method of interaction is a naturally enhanced semi-telepathic holographic user interface that is emitted from a removable device that is linked to biometrics of the corresponding user.  

## Logic Center
  - Logic processor contains equations that are the first step to apply before neural decisions are made.

## Neural Center
  - Builds decision models based on returned logic set.

## Learning Center
  - Devise recipes based on logic equations and neural decisions
  
## Creative Center
  - Take resultset returned from Logic, Neural, and Learning Centers to form the creative idea

## Administration Center
  - Administration manages security, protocols, failures, alerts, and management of protocols.

## Distribution Center
  - Distributes resources through the system.  Communications, goods, nodes, memory allocation, and necessary distributable resources

## User Center
  - User interaction is a semi-telepathic holographic interface linked through a mind mapped biometric security protocol.
  
## Communication Center
  - Handle communications of visual, audio, text, and system Communications
  
## Time Center
  - Manages all things related to Time
