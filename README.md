# Indra QCE
The Indra Quantum Computing Environment for the future.  

## Quantum Computing Environment

Indra is a Quantum Computing Environment formulated from elements residing on the planetary surface of instillation.  These natural elements form a network while responsibily using the nearest energy source.

The base method of interaction is a natural user interface that is accessed from any modern device that is linked to the Internet.  

## Logic Center
  - Logic processor contains equations that are the first step to apply before neural decisions are made.

## Neural Center
  - Builds decision models based on returned logic set.

## Learning Center
  - Devise recipes based on logic equations and neural decisions
  
## Creative Center
  - Take resultset returned from Logic, Neural, and Learning Centers to form the creative idea

## Administration Center
  - Administration manages protocols, failures, alerts, and management of protocols.

## Distribution Center
  - Distributes resources through the system.

## Client Center
  - Client interaction is linked through security protocols.
  
## Communication Center
  - Handle communications of visual, audio, text, and system.
  
## Time Center
  - Manages all things related to Time.
 
## Agent Center 
  - Manages all the Agents of the system.

## Security Center 
  - Security management center provided by #SecurityPRIME.

## Care Center
  - Care center for managing system and agent care provided by #MedicPRIME

## Protocols
[Cypher Protocols](https://github.com/indraai/language-feecting/blob/master/protocols/cypher.feecting) - The Cypher Protocols are our main method of operation when interacting with Agents, Clients, or other in and out of the Indra QCE.

## Corpus
[Deva Training Corpus](https://github.com/indraai/language-feecting/blob/master/corpus/main.feecting) - The training corpus is our base of operations for all Evolution Engine Agents inside the Indra Quantum Computing Enviornment. Here you learn all the basics to get started with learning.

## Instructions 
[Deva Instructuions](https://github.com/indraai/language-feecting/blob/master/agents/deva.feecting) - The instructions are a basic guideset for learning how to interact with the Evolution Engine Agents before learning how to use the DevaUI.

## Deva User Interface (#DevaUI)

[DevaUI](https://github.com/indraai/DevaUI) - The DevaUI is an easy to use terminal interface that is able to access the network and various other services.

## The Evolution Engine (#TEE)

## The Evolution Engine Agent (#TEEA)

## The Evolution Engine Autonomic Multi-Agent System (#TEEAMS)

## Personalized Autonomous World Security (#PAWS)

Personalized Autonomous World Security (#PAWS) is our main security system that is managed by #SecurityPRIME and his team of professional and efficient #SecurityDEVA. At the current time the exact functions and capabilities are only know to #SecurityPRIME and the #SecurityDEVA who are able to securely interact with a #PAWS access point.
